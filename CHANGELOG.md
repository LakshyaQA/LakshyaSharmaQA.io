## [Unreleased]

> Changes that are in progress or planned but not yet committed.

---

## 2026-04-14

### Added

- **QA Automation Sandbox** — Integrated the newly deployed "QA Playground" testing sandbox into the portfolio as a top-level featured project (`profile.js`).
- **Global Header CTA** — Added a standalone, glowing "Try QA Playground" CTA button (`animate-ping`) into the main Header navigation, perfectly load-balanced using flexbox layout spacing.

### Fixed

- **Resume Download Hook** — Fixed an exact case-sensitivity tracking bug for the resume PDF (`/Lakshya...` vs `/lakshya...`) in `profile.js` that was failing the Vercel strict `HEAD` request pre-flight checks, which triggered the "server timeout" error toast.

---

## 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Smart Resume Discovery** — Created `scripts/sync-resume.js` to automatically identify the latest resume PDF in `/public` using keyword matching and timestamps.
- **Creative Toast System** — Implemented a global `ToastProvider` and `useToast` hook for dynamic, "QA-persona" themed notifications.
- **Custom React Hooks** — Added `useResumeDownload.js` to handle secure file verification and creative feedback logic.
- **Modern UI Components** — Created a sleek, animated `Toast.jsx` component using `framer-motion` and glassmorphism.

### Changed

- **Professional Profile** — Refactored `src/data/profile.js` to accurately reflect recent experience at TuningBill Services (Jaipur), updated tech stack (Playwright, Appium, Agentic AI), and reorganized professional projects.
- **EmailJS Security** — Moved all EmailJS credentials from hardcoded constants in `Contact.jsx` to environment variables (`VITE_EMAILJS_*`).
- **Dark Mode** — Upgraded dark mode implementation to use Tailwind v4 `@custom-variant` for better component-level consistency.
- **Build Workflow** — Integrated `sync-resume.js` into `package.json` dev and build hooks to automate asset management.
- **Contact Form Feedback** — Replaced legacy inline status text with site-wide creative toasts for form submissions and email/phone copy actions.

### Fixed

- **Resume Download** — Resolved a 404/400 error on production (Vercel) caused by case-sensitivity mismatches and missing build-time asset syncing.
- **SPA Fallback Handled** — Hardened the `useResumeDownload` hook to check the `Content-Type` header, preventing Vite and Vercel from falsely serving a 6KB `index.html` fallback as a successful PDF download.
- **Contact Form Reliability** — Fixed a background syntax error in `Contact.jsx` that was preventing successful form submissions.
- **Asset Integrity** — Renamed default resume to a professional standard `Lakshya_Sharma_QA_Resume.pdf` and ensured it's tracked by Git in the `/public` folder.
- **Constants Extraction** — Extracted all "QA Humor" toast messages into a dedicated `messages.js` constants file to resolve React Fast Refresh warnings.

### Changed

- **`package.json`** — Renamed project from `app` to `lakshyasharmaqa-portfolio`, bumped version to `1.0.0`, updated Node engine to `24.x`, updated Volta node pin to `24.13.1`, added `@tailwindcss/postcss` to dependencies, added `lint:fix`, `format`, and `format:check` scripts, added `prettier` as devDependency, moved `framer-motion`, `react-intersection-observer`, `react-typed`, `recharts` to `dependencies` (from devDependencies), upgraded `tailwindcss` from `v3` → `v4`, upgraded `vite` from `v7` → `v6`, upgraded `react` and `react-dom` to `v19.2.4`
- **`package-lock.json`** — Updated to reflect new `@tailwindcss/postcss` package and all dependency upgrades
- **`postcss.config.js`** — Replaced `tailwindcss: {}` with `'@tailwindcss/postcss': {}` — required breaking change in Tailwind v4
- **`tailwind.config.js`** — Removed dead theme config (colors, fonts, animations, keyframes) — all moved to `src/index.css @theme` block as per Tailwind v4; kept only `content` and `darkMode`
- **`src/index.css`** — Migrated from `@tailwind base/components/utilities` to `@import "tailwindcss"`, added full `@theme` block with all custom colors (primary/secondary/accent), fonts, and animations
- **`src/App.jsx`** — Fixed dark mode applying inconsistently — removed nested double div, now single div with `dark:` classes driven by `<html>` class toggle; removed unused `profileData` import
- **`src/components/Hero.jsx`** — Moved `qaQuotes` and `typingTexts` outside component to fix `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` ESLint warning; removed duplicate `Lakshya Sharma` h1 (already shown in Header); fixed text-over-image overlap by replacing absolute-positioned image with flexbox two-column layout (`flex-1` text + `flex-shrink-0` image); image now visible on mobile (stacked), side-by-side on desktop
- **`src/components/Experience.jsx`** — Replaced solid green gradient timeline line with subtle dashed gray line using `repeating-linear-gradient`; replaced filled dot with ring-style dot (white center, teal border, inner dot)
- **`vite.config.js`** — Added `build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks` to split large bundle into smaller cacheable chunks — `react-vendor`, `framer-motion`, `recharts` now loaded separately; main `index.js` reduced from **511 KB → 255 KB**
- **`public/lakshyaSharmaQaAutomationEngineerResume.pdf`** — Updated resume content: added new role at TuningBill Ltd, updated location to Jaipur, added smiONE Fintech project, updated AEYE/YAKSHA projects, added ISTQB and Generative AI certifications, updated skills with TypeScript and BrowserStack
- **`README.md`** — Full rewrite: cleaner structure, removed bloated sections, added tech stack table, improved local setup steps, added detailed Vercel deployment guide with auto-deploy explanation; added `Deploy via Vercel CLI` section with all CLI commands: `vercel login`, `vercel`, `vercel --prod`, `vercel ls`, `vercel inspect`

### Fixed

- **`package.json`** — Removed UTF-8 BOM character (`EF BB BF`) from start of file that was causing Vercel deployment to fail with `Unexpected token` JSON parse error
- **`.prettierrc`** — Removed UTF-8 BOM character (same issue)
- **`.prettierignore`** — Removed UTF-8 BOM character (same issue)
- **`vite.config.js`** — Fixed missing closing `})` syntax error that was causing Vercel build to fail with `Expected "}" but found end of file`; also removed stale Emergent agent `allowedHosts` from `server` and `preview` blocks
- **Dark mode** — Was only applying to some components due to nested `dark` class on wrapper div; fixed by toggling `dark` class only on `<html>` element and using a single wrapper div
- **ESLint warning** — `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` on `useEffect` in `Hero.jsx` resolved by moving `qaQuotes` array outside component
- **Hero text overlap** — Description text was overlapping profile image on large screens due to `absolute` positioning; fixed with flexbox layout
- **Timeline UI** — Replaced visually distracting solid green left border line with cleaner dashed style

### Removed

- **`.emergent/emergent.yml`** — Deleted auto-generated Emergent agent config file (not needed)
- **`.gitconfig`** — Deleted auto-generated Emergent agent git config (not needed)

> **Note:** Windows text editors sometimes save files with a UTF-8 BOM prefix which breaks JSON parsing on Linux-based systems like Vercel. All BOM characters were removed from config files.
